Simulation workflow:

Edit parameters in [file].py
Run simulation with simulator.py
 - configuration is in configuration.py
Results will be put in a folder and zipped so we can run them again in the future  (to do)

We should also create a tool that takes a tar file as an argument and re-runs a previous simulation.

APIs:

class simulation:
   __init__
   setup          - creates agents and social network
   run            - iterates through timesteps, calling play() on each agent, postprocess(), and gathering statistics
   save_results   - saves graphs of the run and all python scripts in a tar  (should this be in simulator.py?)
                  - this should pass a list of files up to the simulator, and the simulator can take care of zipping them.
                  
class agent:
   __init__
   play         - decide to participate or not (returns T/F)
   postprocess  - receive reward (if any) and update accordingly
   difference   - returns difference between 2 agents (for similarity estimation) (or should this be in simulation class?)
