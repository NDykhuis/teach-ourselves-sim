1  sim_2011-11-09_01:05:56 -- no learning, no external reward -- just based on
     intrinsic interest and neighbors' actions. but there are weights

2  sim_2011-11-09_01:15:33 -- no learning, no external reward, no weights.
     participation is increased, but weights did not previously play into the
     calculation. so why is participation higher? each student's network is now
     different, since similarity is based on weights. each student's network is
     now presumably larger, since weights are all in common

3  sim_2011-11-09_01:23:15 -- external reward is the constant function 1. no
     learning, no weights, so expected reward is just skill

4  sim_2011-11-09_01:35:44 -- external reward is now a linear function from 0 to 1.
     no learning, no weights. see a slight increase in participation, but not
     much

5  sim_2011-11-09_01:37:39 -- external reward now goes from 0 to 2. see same
     increase around same reward level as last expr, and a much larger increase
     later on as external reward dominates I and S, which range between -1 and 1

6  sim_2011-11-09_01:49:05 -- logistic equation from .5 to 1. see same increase
     in participation, but earlier. 

7  sim_2011-11-09_01:53:53 -- this should be the same as expr 3. check? looks
     like it. compare to expr 6: large participation at start, stays constant

8  sim_2011-11-09_02:04:31 -- logistic from .5 to 2, large increase in
     participation. see same final result as linear that ends at 2, just increases
     earlier

9  sim_2011-11-09_10:55:44 -- dramatic shift in reward from 0 to 1, then drop
    it back down. social effects in place, so participation falls after reward is
    dropped, but still much above levels before reward was raised

10 sim_2011-11-09_12:10:03 -- same reward scheme as 9, but took out social
    effects. Now, participation falls back to old levels after reward is
    eliminated

11 sim_2011-11-14_10:52:34 -- random clustering. reward increases from 0 to 10
    (scaled by .1) suddenly, then drops back down to 0. graph is quite noisy, but
    participation seems to drop back down to the same level as before once the
    reward is taken away
